I am a first-year JD/PhD student at Duke University [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.duke.edu/) and [School of Law](https://law.duke.edu/).

For my PhD studies, I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/). My research revolves around interpretable machine learning, where we develop models that are transparent, trustworthy, and reliable. 

I obtained my BSc in Computer Science from Duke University, where I graduated with [Highest Distinction](https://cs.duke.edu/undergraduate/research/distinction) and [Alex Vasilos Memorial Award](https://cs.duke.edu/undergrad/awards). During this period, I worked with [Prof. Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/), [Prof. Bhuwan Dhingra](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~bdhingra/), [Prof. Brandon Fain](https://sites.duke.edu/btfain/), and [Prof. Jian Pei](https://ece.duke.edu/people/jian-pei/) on various machine learning topics, such as interpretable machine learning for risk prediction, natural language processing for healthcare, and topic modelling.

When I'm not doing research, I enjoy photography and playing tennis.
